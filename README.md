# Installation

If not available from the marketplace, please download the release and manually load it in Logseq.

# Usage

1. Start writing your prose.
2. When you are done, click the plugin icon (as shown in the video above), and a list of suggestions will be made available at the end of the page.
3. Do note that the plugin can be used everywhere except the main page with the list of running journal entries.
4. As the suggestions are provided by an external package, any errors or requests of the actual suggestions should be made directly to the package repository [here](https://github.com/btford/write-good).
